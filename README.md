# anomaly-detection-explanation
Detecting and explaining anomalies in event stream monitoring
### Objective 
Implementing an anomaly detection algorithm that also provides meaningful explanations for anomalous behaviors, allowing the user to prevent or remedy the effect of an anomaly
### Motivation
An attempt to implement some techniques in this [paper](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~ameli/papers/EDBT2017.pdf), and experiment with some new ones to try and get better results.
### Process
Have outlined the process flow below - will be updating soon after I'm done experimenting with some new techniques I've been looking to integrate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>  ![img](https://i.ibb.co/P1m7JgC/ano-det-flow.png)
